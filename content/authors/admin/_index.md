## About Me

√Ångela Alviz is a conservation biologist specializing in Neotropical mammal ecology, with a decade of field experience in Colombia's Orinoquia region. Her research focuses on endangered species conservation, particularly Lowland Tapir (*Tapirus terrestris*) and Giant Otter (*Pteronura brasiliensis*), integrating ecological modeling with indigenous knowledge. 

As former Scientific Director of Fundaci√≥n Orinoquia Biodiversa, she led 15+ conservation projects establishing biological corridors, developing species management plans, and creating new protected areas. Her work has been recognized with the WWF's Russell E. Train Fellowship and multiple presentation awards from scientific societies.

√Ångela's approach bridges rigorous science with practical conservation, emphasizing:
- Landscape-scale connectivity solutions
- Evidence-based protected area design
- Community-led conservation initiatives
- Policy-relevant ecological research
